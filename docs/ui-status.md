## 1. Current Role

The Smart UI is officially classified as a:

**Demo and Intent Layer**

It exists to:
- demonstrate user flows
- visualize protocol concepts
- collect configuration intent
- support founder-facing demos and previews

It does **not** represent protocol authority.

---

## 2. Authority Clarification

The Smart UI has **no authority** over:

- protocol logic
- token economics
- transaction execution
- on-chain state
- lifecycle enforcement

All protocol authority lives in:
- `smart-core`
- `smart-cli`
- `docs`

The UI reflects decisions.  
It does not make them.

---

## 3. Transitional Components

The following elements exist for **demo purposes only**:

- API routes inside the UI
- Local database persistence
- Simulated deployments
- Mock transaction hashes
- Local validation rules
- Cross-repo filesystem reads

These components:
- are non-authoritative
- must not be expanded
- must not be reused as backend infrastructure

---

## 4. Change Policy

The Smart UI is currently **frozen**.

Allowed changes:
- critical build fixes
- dependency security patches
- explicit demo labeling

Forbidden changes:
- new features
- new integrations
- protocol logic additions
- backend expansion
- architectural refactors

Any exception requires a new ADR.

---

## 5. Integration Outlook

Future integration with real protocol state will occur only via:
- `smart-cli`
- explicitly documented read-only contracts

No direct integration with `smart-core` is permitted.

---

## 6. Final Statement

**The Smart UI is a window, not an engine.  
It shows the system.  
It does not run it.**
