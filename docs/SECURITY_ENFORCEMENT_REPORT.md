❌ `internal-ops` — PRIVATE  
❌ Any repository with operational logic, security assumptions, or infrastructure details

## 📊 FILES MODIFIED

### Created
1. `docs/REPOSITORY_VISIBILITY_POLICY.md` — Security policy
2. `docs/SECURITY_ENFORCEMENT_REPORT.md` — This report

### Modified
1. `docs/ORGANIZATION.md` — Removed smart-cli reference
2. `docs/README.md` — Removed smart-cli link

### Verified Compliant
1. `src/App.jsx` — Footer links (no changes needed)

---

## ⚠️ REMAINING REFERENCES (Context Only)

The following files contain references to private repositories in **policy/documentation context only** (not as public links):

### Acceptable References
- `docs/REPOSITORY_VISIBILITY_POLICY.md` — Defines what is private (policy document)
- `docs/adr/0001-smart-ui-backend-boundary.md` — Historical ADR (internal doc)
- `docs/adr/0002-ui-as-demo-and-intent-layer.md` — Historical ADR (internal doc)
- `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` — Internal setup guide
- `docs/adr/0002-ui-as-demo-and-intent-layer.md` — Definição do Smart UI como Demo Layer

**These are acceptable** because:
1. They are internal documentation
2. They define boundaries and policies
3. They do not publicly link or expose private repos
4. They serve governance and architectural purposes
