## ✅ What Was Implemented

The following components were successfully implemented:

1. **Address Validation Utilities** (`src/utils/addressValidation.js`)
   - ✅ `validateAddress()` - Validates Ethereum addresses with EIP-55 checksum
   - ✅ `formatAddress()` - Formats addresses for display
   - ✅ `isSameAddress()` - Case-insensitive address comparison
   - ✅ `formatHash()` - Formats transaction hashes

2. **UI Component** (`src/components/ui/AddressInput.jsx`)
   - ✅ Real-time validation with visual feedback
   - ✅ Error messages for invalid addresses
   - ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality
   - ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

3. **Integration**
   - ✅ WalletConnect component uses validation
   - ✅ App.jsx uses validation utilities

## 🔍 Review Tasks

### Code Quality Review

- [ ] Review `src/utils/addressValidation.js`
  - [ ] Verify all validation logic is correct
  - [ ] Check error messages are user-friendly
  - [ ] Ensure proper use of ethers.js functions
  - [ ] Verify EIP-55 checksum compliance

- [ ] Review `src/components/ui/AddressInput.jsx`
  - [ ] Check component follows React best practices
  - [ ] Verify accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - [ ] Test visual feedback on validation
  - [ ] Verify copy-to-clipboard works correctly

- [ ] Review Integration Points
  - [ ] Check WalletConnect.jsx integration
  - [ ] Verify App.jsx usage
  - [ ] Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

### Testing Review

- [ ] Verify linting passes
- [ ] Verify build passes
- [ ] Manual testing of AddressInput component
- [ ] Test with valid addresses
- [ ] Test with invalid addresses (various formats)
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty, null, malformed)

---

## 🧪 Missing Test Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Unit Tests Needed

Create `src/__tests__/utils/addressValidation.test.js`:

- [ ] Test `validateAddress()` with valid addresses
- [ ] Test `validateAddress()` with invalid formats
- [ ] Test `validateAddress()` with wrong checksum
- [ ] Test `validateAddress()` with empty/null input
- [ ] Test `formatAddress()` formatting
- [ ] Test `isSameAddress()` comparison
- [ ] Test edge cases

### Component Tests Needed

Create `src/__tests__/components/ui/AddressInput.test.jsx`:

- [ ] Test component renders correctly
- [ ] Test validation on user input
- [ ] Test error message display
- [ ] Test copy functionality
- [ ] Test disabled state
- [ ] Test required field indicator
- [ ] Test keyboard interactions

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test WalletConnect validation flow
- [ ] Test address normalization in callbacks

---

## 📝 Documentation Review

- [ ] Check if README needs updates
- [ ] Verify JSDoc comments are complete
- [ ] Add usage examples if needed
- [ ] Document any breaking changes

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Address

### Critical
- **Missing Test Coverage** - No tests exist for the validation functionality

### Medium Priority
- **Accessibility** - AddressInput could use better ARIA labels
- **Animation** - No support for `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Low Priority
- **Internationalization** - Error messages are hardcoded in English
- **Performance** - Consider debouncing validation if needed
