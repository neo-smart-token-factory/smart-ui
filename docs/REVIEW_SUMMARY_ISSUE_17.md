---

## 🚨 Critical Finding

**The only significant issue is the lack of automated tests.** The implementation is functionally complete and works correctly, but needs test coverage before it can be considered production-ready.

---

## 📝 Recommendations

### For Issue #17
✅ **Mark as implemented** - The core functionality is complete and working

### For Follow-up Work
Create a sub-issue using the template in `docs/SUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE_REVIEW_17.md` to track:
1. **Unit tests** for validation utilities (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. **Component tests** for AddressInput (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. **Accessibility improvements** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
