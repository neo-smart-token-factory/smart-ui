## ⏳ Implement Loading States for Better UX Feedback

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Phase:** Phase 01 → Phase 02 Preparation  
**Category:** UX/UI Enhancement

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

Currently, the application lacks proper loading states for async operations, leaving users without feedback during:
- Wallet connection attempts
- Transaction processing
- API calls
- Form submissions
- Data fetching

### Current State

- ❌ No loading spinners during wallet connection
- ❌ No feedback when transactions are processing
- ❌ Silent API calls (users don't know if something is happening)
- ❌ No progress indicators for multi-step processes
- ❌ Users may click buttons multiple times thinking nothing happened

### Impact

**User Experience:**
- Confusion about whether actions are processing
- Multiple clicks on buttons (causing duplicate requests)
- No sense of progress
- Perceived slowness even when operations are fast

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Add loading states to WalletConnect**
   - Spinner during connection attempt
   - Disable button while connecting
   - Show connection progress

2. **Add loading states to TransactionStatus**
   - Show pending state with spinner
   - Progress indicators for transaction confirmation
   - Loading states for explorer links

3. **Add loading states to API operations**
   - Loading indicators for form submissions
   - Skeleton loaders for data fetching
   - Progress bars for long operations

4. **Create reusable Loading components**
   - `LoadingSpinner` component
   - `LoadingButton` component
   - `SkeletonLoader` component
   - `ProgressBar` component

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Reusable Loading Components

**File:** `src/components/LoadingSpinner.jsx`
```jsx
export default function LoadingSpinner({ size = 'md', className = '' }) {
  const sizeClasses = {
    sm: 'w-4 h-4',
    md: 'w-6 h-6',
    lg: 'w-8 h-8'
  };
  
  return (
    <div className={`animate-spin ${sizeClasses[size]} ${className}`}>
      <Loader2 className="w-full h-full text-neon-acid" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**File:** `src/components/LoadingButton.jsx`
```jsx
export default function LoadingButton({ 
  loading, 
  children, 
  disabled,
  ...props 
}) {
  return (
    <button
      disabled={loading || disabled}
      className={cn(
        'btn-primary',
        loading && 'opacity-50 cursor-wait',
        className
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      {loading ? (
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <LoadingSpinner size="sm" />
          <span>Processando...</span>
        </div>
      ) : (
        children
      )}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Phase 2: Add Loading States to WalletConnect

**Changes needed:**
- Track connection state (`isConnecting`)
- Show spinner during connection
- Disable button while connecting
- Show connection progress steps

### Phase 3: Add Loading States to Transaction Flow

**Changes needed:**
- Show pending state immediately
- Progress indicators for confirmation
- Loading states for explorer data

### Phase 4: Add Loading States to Forms

**Changes needed:**
- Loading state on deploy button
- Disable form during submission
- Show progress for multi-step forms

- [ ] WalletConnect shows loading state
- [ ] TransactionStatus shows loading state
- [ ] Forms show loading during submission
- [ ] API calls show loading feedback
- [ ] No duplicate requests from multiple clicks
- [ ] Smooth loading animations
