## 🧪 Create Test Suite for Wallet Connection and Critical Components

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Phase:** Phase 02 Blocker  
**Category:** Testing/Quality Assurance

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

Currently, the application has **zero test coverage** for wallet connection and critical components. This makes it risky to make changes and difficult to ensure quality before Phase 02 production launch.

### Current State

- ❌ No unit tests
- ❌ No integration tests
- ❌ No E2E tests
- ❌ No test infrastructure
- ❌ Changes may break functionality without detection

### Impact

**Development:**

- Fear of breaking changes
- Difficult to refactor safely
- No regression testing
- Manual testing required for every change

**Quality:**

- Bugs may reach production
- No confidence in releases
- Difficult to verify fixes

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Set up test infrastructure**
   - Choose testing framework (Vitest recommended for Vite)
   - Configure test environment
   - Set up test utilities

2. **Create unit tests**
   - Test ErrorBoundary component
   - Test wallet hooks (useDynamicWallet)
   - Test utility functions
   - Test validation functions

3. **Create integration tests**
   - Test wallet connection flow
   - Test transaction flow
   - Test API integration
   - Test error handling

4. **Create E2E tests** (optional but recommended)
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Test wallet connection end-to-end
   - Test form submission flow

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom
```

**Create `vitest.config.js`:**
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.js'
  }
});
```

### Phase 2: Unit Tests

**Test files to create:**

- `src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.jsx`
- `src/components/__tests__/WalletConnect.test.jsx`
- `src/hooks/__tests__/useFeatures.test.js`
- `src/utils/__tests__/addressValidation.test.js`

### Phase 3: Integration Tests

**Test files to create:**

- `src/__tests__/integration/wallet-connection.test.jsx`
- `src/__tests__/integration/transaction-flow.test.jsx`
- `src/__tests__/integration/api-integration.test.js`

### Phase 4: E2E Tests (Optional)

**Using Playwright:**

- `e2e/wallet-connection.spec.js`
- `e2e/token-deployment.spec.js`

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Test infrastructure set up
- [ ] Unit tests for ErrorBoundary
- [ ] Unit tests for wallet hooks
- [ ] Integration tests for wallet flow
- [ ] Integration tests for transaction flow
- [ ] Test coverage > 70% for critical components
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests
- [ ] Tests pass before merge

## 📊 Test Coverage Goals

| Component | Target Coverage |
|-----------|----------------|
| ErrorBoundary | 90% |
| WalletConnect | 80% |
| TransactionStatus | 80% |
| Hooks | 85% |
| Utils | 95% |
