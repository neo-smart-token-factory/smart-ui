## 🚨 Security Issue: Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Phase:** Phase 01 → Phase 02 Blocker

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

After completing the wallet connection audit (PR #11), we identified **8 HIGH severity vulnerabilities** in @dynamic-labs dependencies. These vulnerabilities persist even after downgrading to version 4.56.0 because they are **transitive dependencies** within @dynamic-labs-wallet packages.

### Vulnerabilities

```
8 high severity vulnerabilities
- axios 1.0.0 - 1.11.0 (DoS attack via lack of data size check)
- Affected packages:
  - @dynamic-labs-wallet/browser
  - @dynamic-labs-wallet/core
  - @dynamic-labs-wallet/forward-mpc-client
  - @dynamic-labs-wallet/forward-mpc-shared
  - @dynamic-labs-sdk/client
```

**CVE/Advisory:** https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj

---

## 🔍 Current Status

- ✅ **Version locked:** @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core@4.56.0
- ✅ **Version locked:** @dynamic-labs/ethers-v6@4.56.0
- ❌ **Vulnerabilities:** Still present (transitive dependencies)
- ⚠️ **Root cause:** axios vulnerable version inside @dynamic-labs-wallet packages

### Attempted Fixes

1. ✅ Downgraded to 4.56.0 (as recommended in audit)
2. ✅ Fixed package.json to lock versions
3. ❌ Vulnerabilities persist (transitive deps)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Investigate** if there's a Dynamic Labs version without these vulnerabilities
2. **Test** if `npm audit fix --force` works without breaking changes
3. **Monitor** Dynamic Labs security advisories for patches
4. **Document** workaround or mitigation strategy
5. **Resolve** before Phase 02 launch (Q1 2026)

## 🔧 Tasks for Copilot

### Phase 1: Investigation
- [ ] Check all available @dynamic-labs versions for one without vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test older versions (4.50.x, 4.55.x) to see if they're clean
- [ ] Verify if latest version (4.57.2) has fixes
- [ ] Check Dynamic Labs GitHub for security patches/announcements

### Phase 2: Testing
- [ ] Test `npm audit fix --force` in isolated branch
- [ ] Verify wallet connection still works after fix
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no breaking changes
- [ ] Check bundle size and performance impact

### Phase 3: Resolution
- [ ] Implement fix (version update or workaround)
- [ ] Update package.json with secure versions
- [ ] Update SECURITY_SUMMARY.md with resolution
- [ ] Create PR with fix and test results

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Document final solution
- [ ] Update audit reports if needed
- [ ] Add monitoring strategy for future vulnerabilities

## ⚠️ Constraints

- **Phase 01:** Can accept documented limitation for controlled environment
- **Phase 02:** MUST be resolved before production launch
- **Breaking changes:** Must be tested thoroughly
- **Wallet functionality:** Must remain working

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] 0 HIGH severity vulnerabilities in npm audit
- [ ] Wallet connection functionality verified
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created and ready for review
